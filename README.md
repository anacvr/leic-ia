* Optimization Methods/Meta-Heuristics

### [Project 1: Terrace Game](terrace/README.md)

***Topic:* Adversarial Search Methods for Two-Player Board Games**

* Developing the AI for a 2-player game called Terrace by implementing the Minimax Algorithm (with alpha beta cuts).

#### Features Implemented

* Game graphics using python's pygame library
* Game interface
* Game rules
* Menu
    * Human-human, human-computer, and computer-computer game modes
    * Different level of difficulty (easy, medium, hard), that differentiate in the depth limit for the Minimax algorithm and the heuristics used to evaluate the game state
* Algorithms:
    * Minimax with alpha beta pruning, with different depth levels

**Bonus Features:**

* Music when the player wins
* Instructions and game legend
* Menu to allow the user to play again in the same mode
