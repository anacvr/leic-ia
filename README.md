## Assignment No. 1
* Heuristic Search Methods for Problem-Solving
* Adversarial Search Methods for Games
* Optimization Methods/Meta-Heuristics

### [Project 1: Terrace Game](terrace/README.md)

***Topic:* Adversarial Search Methods for Two-Player Board Games**

* Developing the AI for a 2-player game called Terrace by implementing the Minimax Algorithm (with alpha beta cuts).

#### Features Implemented

* Game graphics using python's pygame library
* Game interface
* Game rules
* Menu
    * Human-human, human-computer, and computer-computer game modes
    * Different level of difficulty (easy, medium, hard), that differentiate in the depth limit for the Minimax algorithm and the heuristics used to evaluate the game state
* Algorithms:
    * Minimax with alpha beta pruning, with different depth levels

**Bonus Features:**

* Music when the player wins
* Instructions and game legend
* Menu to allow the user to play again in the same mode



## Assignment No. 2
* Supervised Learning

### [Project 2: Prediction of Autism Spectrum Disorder in Toddlers](machine%20learning/README.md)

***Topic:** Application of Machine Learning Models and Algorithms Related to Supervised Learning*

* Conduct exploratory data analysis to understand class distribution and attribute values.
* Utilize various supervised learning algorithms (e.g., Decision Trees, Neural Networks, K-NN, SVM).
* Compare algorithm performance using evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 measure.
* Evaluate models on both training and test sets.
